# Responsibility Without Ownership

This repository defines responsibility as a structural condition,
not a claim of authorship.

In HCM:
- actions may occur
- outcomes may appear
- effects may propagate

Without assigning ownership.

No entity is credited.
No agent is blamed.
No source is claimed.

Responsibility exists without possession.
